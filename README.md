Implement immutable data structures where applicable.
Educate the team on the benefits and usage of immutability.

### 4. Integration of 5S and DOP

#### Workflow Optimization

- Objective: Ensure that 5S practices support DOP principles.
- Actions:
Align 5S activities with DOP requirements (e.g., organizing data structures).
Use 5S audits to identify opportunities for improving data handling.

#### Continuous Improvement

- Objective: Foster a culture of continuous improvement.
- Actions:
Encourage team members to suggest improvements for both 5S and DOP practices.
